Multilib is a library supporting various languages that aims to provide many useful methods and to make working in different environments easier.

The main goal of this project is to include as many useful classes/functions/utilities as possible in as many different languages as possible. Java, C#, PHP, and Python are the main languages supported and focused on in this library. Everyone is encouraged to add support for other languages and contribute to the project. More languages such as C, C++, JavaScript, and Ruby will be added in the future.

Database connections and interactions, sending HTTP requests (optionally supporting SSL), and cryptographic operations are a big part of this library. Much more functionality will be provided in the near future and this document will be updated to reflect the state of this project as well as to document the various capabilities for each language that this library provides.
